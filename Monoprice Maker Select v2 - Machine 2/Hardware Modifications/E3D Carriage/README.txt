# Summary

#Wanhao Duplicator I3 Bowden Extruder for E3D V6 / Clone

I wanted to install a Bowden extruder on my i3 but I had some requirements of my own. I couldn't find one that meet all the requirements so I set out to make a hybrid of two great mounts by JonBAL and Tech2C. So I present the ChandersV6R0!

#####Skills Needed
1. Patience
2. Soldering
3. Troubleshooting

#####Tools Needed
1. Standard set of allen keys provided by Wanhao
2. Soldering iron / solder / heat shrink
3. Snips
4. 3D printer to print the parts

#####Parts Needed
1. E3D v6 (J-head) hotend for 1.75mm 
Comes with cooling fan, heat break, heating block, heater cartridge, nozzle, PTFE tube for 1.75mm 
2. Some cable management tubing
3. M3 and M4 nuts screws and bolts of assorted lengths
4. 12V DC 50mm Blower Radial Cooling Fan

#####Parts Reused
1. M4 screws that hold existing assembly to the bearing block
2. M2 screws for X-Axis Endstop
3. Thermistor (I didn't want to recompile the firmware for another thermistor)
The stock heater will not fit the new heating block so you will need to get one with the kit


********************************************************************************************************
#### READ IMPORTANT!
This mount changes the Z and Y distances of the hotend. You WILL need to print replacement mounts for the end stops. I used these two 

Z - [Here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:928008 "Z-End Stop")
Y - In STLs

**DO THIS NOW!!**
********************************************************************************************************

#####Extruder Stepper Motor Mount
Once we remove the assembly we will need to find somewhere to put the extruder stepper motor. I used [these](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1489794). NOTE these mounts are made for a specific pneumatic fitting diameter. MAKE SURE the one you print will fit your pneumatic fitting.

#####X-Axis Belt Mount
Once we remove the assembly we will need to find somewhere to anchor the X-Axis belts. The assembly has two M4 hole locations that will be used to zip tie the belts to. NOTE I printed this section of the mount at 100% infill since it will have to bear the forces of the tightened belts. I also used [these](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1071695) tensioners to tension the belts when complete.

#####Bearing Mount
This assembly is for a Wanhao i3 and clones V2.1. If you have an i3 that is <2.1 you may need to print bearing mounts ( or not as you may be able to line up the holes on the assembly). 

#####Things to note
Removing the cables from the drag chain is a B%$#&! I had to remove the connectors on the open end, pull them through and re solder them. You will need to get creative. OR you can take the chain apart, your choice.

You will need to solder the new heater cartridge to the existing wires from the old heater cartridge. Make sure to heat shrink it or use electrical tape.

I used Kapton tape to keep the wires tidy close to the hot end and zip ties higher up.

The assembly that holds the extruder in place may be a little tight or slightly slack depending on if you are using a real V6 or a clone. Once its tightened it will work perfectly.

I am continuously improving the design so the pictures may not match the STLs 100%.

I left out steps that I thought were simple but if you have any questions or need clarifications please feel free to let me know!

#####Please let me know if you made one!


# Print Settings

Printer: Wanda Duplicator i3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 65%

Notes: 
You will need to print the section of the mount where the M4 bolts hold the X-Axis belts at 100% for strength due to the tightening forces.

You will need to print a section of the fan duct with supports.

# Post-Printing

I didn't include the hose clamps as these will need to be custom sized for your cable management,
