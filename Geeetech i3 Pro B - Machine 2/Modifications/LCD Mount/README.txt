# Summary

I have since a while switched from a direct extruder to a bowden extruder that I have mounted in the middle on the top of my frame.

Now this posses the problem that the LCD screen is not able to be mounted at the top of the frame anymore, for this purpose I have designed a simple clip that slides into the original LCD acrylic frame and over the end plate of the Y-axis.

As you can see my printer is mounted on vibration mounts, but without the mounts the LCD still has no problem with clearing with the surface the printer is standing on.

<b>V2</b>
I added a little extra length to the clamp itself and the bracket to ensure that there is a slightly more secure grip on the frame so that it does not bump off as soon.
