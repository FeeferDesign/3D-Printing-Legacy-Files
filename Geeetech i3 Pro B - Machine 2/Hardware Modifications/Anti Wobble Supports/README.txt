# Summary

Remix of this item for a better print. Thanks Jimmy.

The images are from the mod  on my printer. Zoom into the Before/AFTER images to see the difference.

# Print Settings

Printer: Geeetech Full Metal Aluminum
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 01.
Infill: 20% 

Notes: 
Using a higher resolution because we need a smoother curve for the top. Also a thicker top layer will be better.


# Post-Printing

## Additional notes

Print a few of these because if there is a lot of wobble, the top of the printed part (curved) will eventually wear down. 
Another option is to place a steel washer - 8 to 9 mm between the X axis idler frame and this part's curved section to reduce the wear and tear on the printed part as it moves to accommodate your wobble. See the original video, especially the last part, where the reasoning for this part becomes obvious.

# How I Designed This

Imported into Sketchup, measured and reconstructed with curves and circles with 90 sides.
Build plate included.

# Custom Section

## Update 27 Mar 2016

There was a request to modify this THINGI to use the original flanged nut. Because this is plastic and the tolerances for metal are quite high, this THINGI may not fit.

Have made the modification and files uploaded - bbGeeetech_aluminum_prusa_i3_anti-wobble2.stl . Please let me know in the comments if this fits OK.

## Update: 15 April 2016

If you have problems with the X axis bottoming out on the coupler, then see this for a solution:
